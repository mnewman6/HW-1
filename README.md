## **EquityZen: Case Study**

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company 

    - EquityZen.
    
* When was the company incorporated?

  -    EquityZen was created May 1st, 2013.

* Who are the founders of the company?

    - Atish Davda, Phil Haslett, Shriram Bhashyam.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    - EquityZen was created to solve two problems: the first - a lack of liquidity available to individuals holding equity in private businesses; and second, to democratize the ability to access private markets.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    - As of July 2017, EquityZen has raised a total of 11.3 million dollars in the form of six separate funding rounds. Most recently, they raised 3 million dollars in a series B funding round from 4 investors.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - EquityZen is solving two problems by creating a market place to trade pre-IPO equity. By creating this online market place, EquityZen allows accredited investors to purchase this equity and creates an early exit strategy for current stakeholders. One of the most burdensome aspects as an individual holding equity in a private business is a lack of liquidity. EquityZen is solving this issue and democratizing the access to private markets.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    - EquityZen's primary customers are accreddited investors. Accreddited investors are defined as individuals or businesses who are allowed to deal in securities that may not be registered with financial authorities. Individuals qualify as accreddited investors if they earn more than $250,000 per year.

    - EquityZen is a technology driven company. They are the disruptors in the private market space, and are competing against large institutional banks, private equity, and VC firms. They gain a competitive advantage through their technology tools, their focus on transparency, and their initiative to work directly with the underlying companies. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    - One of the the main technology products EquityZen utilizes is Liquidity Manager. Liquidity Manager is software provided to streamline the communication, documentation, and transparency between the transacting company and the EquityZen investors.  


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    -   EquityZen is a broker dealer and operates exclusively in the secondary markets.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    - As more companies delay their IPO process in favor of remaining private for longer, the need for liquidity in private markets has never been greater. What was once thought of as exclusive domain for large institutional financial players and the ultra-wealthy, is now more accessible to the public. Technology has played a large role in the evolution and transformation of the secondary markets industry. By streamlining the arduous process of selling privately held equity, more shareholders feel comfortable liquidating their shares before a traditional liquidity event. This increase in transparency has led to a boom on the supply and demand side of private equity. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    - EquityZen's major competitors are similar tech startups such as Forge, SharesPost, and Second Market. Additionally, Vanguard recently announced they will bring to market a private equity ETF. While not a direct competitor to EquityZen, an ETF will serve as an alternative for investors interested in participating in private markets. 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    - EquityZen is looking to bring transparency to the secondary markets trading industry. One of EquityZen's core beliefs is that the company itself is a key stakeholder in the transaction process - not just simply the buyer and seller. For this reason, EquityZen has remained largely removed from an ongoing investigation by the SEC into other players in the industry. EquityZen is setting a new gold standard in the industry in terms of technology, user interface, and reliability. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    - Key Financial Metrics
        - 80,000+ shareholders and investors on EquityZen
        - 11,000+ investments closed
        - 575 Billion dollar total market cap of transacted companies
        - Works with 15 of the top 25 "Unicorns" 
        - 26 exits from EquityZen's 38 private investments including Lyft, Slack, MongoDB, Spotify, and GitHub
    

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    - Comparable metrics are difficult to find given the unique business model of EquityZen and the scarcity of information for private startups. However, the most important metrics would be the growth rate of adding shareholders and investors onto the platform, the total number of businesses available on the platform for investment, and the return provided by those companies triggered by a liquidity event. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - If I were to advise EquityZen one of my recommendations would be to diversify their streams of revenue and launch a new crowdfunding product.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    -   A crowdfunding product would benefit the company in a few different ways. First, it would give EquityZen exposure to companies that they would potentially do business with at an earlier stage in their business cycle. By establishing a relationship earlier on in the life of the company, EquityZen would position themselves to be a more favorable partner later when key stakeholders may be looking to liquidate their positions. Secondly, this would diversify EquityZen's current revenues and protect the business from other broker dealers who may be looking to increase their presence in the secondary markets trading industry. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    -  Similar technologies EquityZen is already utilizing would be needed to launch this service such as a CRM database for investors, a digital payment tool, and digital marketing to attract additional investors. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - These technologies would create synergies with EquityZen's current business model because of the natural overlap that exists between the investors looking to invest in mid-stage companies, and those with a slightly larger appetite for risk, willing to invest in earlier stage companies.
